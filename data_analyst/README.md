## Interviews

### Coding Test

Before you are a data scientist, you must be a programmer. There will be a coding test on [codility](https://www.codility.com/) before the interview. You will be requested to answer two quesions within hours. The interview will proceed depending on your result on codility. If you successfully pass, you will move on to the next stage.

### Assignment

We, [KKStream](https://www.kkstream.com.tw/en/), had hosted competitions on Kaggle in 2017, and made available de-identified playback data sets from [KKTV](https://www.kktv.me/). One of our Kaggle in-class competitions aimed at predicting the time when customers watched drama. Detailed description and the submission instructions are available on the competition link.

To complete the assignments, join the competition and get both raw and [pre-processed datasets](./assignment_01/preprocessed_datasets.zip). Run the [script](./assignment_01/experiments.py) to make predictions with pre-processed dataset. Submit the result to Kaggle and get the score. The score should be around 0.85. After that, write your own script to process the raw dataset. Your goal is to create a new pre-processed dataset just like the one we provided. After you are done, send back the source code, and MD5 of your final submission along with your Kaggle account for confirmation.
